# SimulationArt
A Unity project with a collection of small simulations.

## Purpose
This project is a "sandbox" environment for any simulations I might try making as practice projects.

## Features
Contains 2 simulations so far:
1. Tiny Particle Orbits
   * Simulates tiny particles orbiting *n* larger planets.
   * The planets are static. The particles are dynamically orbiting the planets and affected by gravity from all of them at once.

2. Heat Diffusion
   * Simulates temperature diffusing amongst a variable number of particles.
   * User can add or remove heat to view the temperature reach a new equilibrium.
