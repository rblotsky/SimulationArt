# SimulationArt
A Unity project with a collection of small simulations.

## Purpose
This project is a "sandbox" environment for any simulations I might try making as practice projects.

## Features
Contains 1 simulation so far:
1. Tiny Particle Orbits
  * Simulates tiny particles orbiting *n* larger planets.
  * The planets are static. The particles are dynamically orbiting the planets and affected by gravity from all of them at once.
